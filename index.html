  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.
</p>
<p align="center">

    please see our paper

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  The workshop is funded by <a href="//www.nerc.ac.uk/">NERC</a> as part of the 
  <a href="//www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/available/postgrad/advanced/atsc/">
  Advanced Training Short Courses</a> programme.
  Priority will thus be given to 
  NERC-funded PhD students and early career researchers from the environmental 
  sciences who should register below or contact <a href="mailto:a.walker@leeds.ac.uk">Andrew Walkeer</a>
  for further information. Some funding to cover travel and accommodation costs of 
  these participants is available. Any unallocated spaces will be made generally available 
  in December.
</p>

<p id="who">
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers.
  <strong>You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will
    be presented at the workshop.</strong> 
</p>

<p>
  This is the second of two workshops in January aimed at the NERC community and funded by the ATSC 
  scheme.
  This one is aimed at participants with very little (or no) 
  prior knowledge of programming but who want to develop some knowledge of python, 
  and an understanding of good practice in scientific computing and the tools that 
  make this possible.
  The workshop <a href='http://andreww.github.io/2017-01-04-bristol/'
  >held in very early January in Bristol</a> will be more appropriate 
  for those with more background knowledge. If you are not sure which workshop is best for you 
  please get in touch with us.

  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these

        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all
      <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).

<h2>Before the workshop</h2>
<p>
There are a three extra tasks to undertake before the workshop in 
order to help make sure things run smoothly. Please try to do the
following.
</p>
<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
<h3>1. Grab free accounts</h3>
<p>
If you haven't already, please register for free accounts to 
<ul>
<li>Make use of Github. Register <a href='https://github.com/'>here</a> and don't forget your password. We will use this service as part of the lesson on version control.</li>
<li>Use the Met Office datapoint API. Register for an account 
<a href='http://register.metoffice.gov.uk/register/datapoint'>here</a>. We may use this as a data source for some of the exercises.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>2. Tell us about yourself</h3>
<p>Finally, please compleate the pre-workshop 
survay <a href='https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/swc_pre_workshop_v1?workshop_id=2016-06-27-leeds'>here</a></p>
</div>

<!-- Make the next bit accessable before the start of day 1 -->
<!--

<hr/>
  <h2>During and after the workshop</h2>
  <p> We have gathered together the various links you will need and useful 
      information below. These will remain accessable after the workshop and 
      we will add to this list as the workshop progresses. Please read and 
      abide by the <a href='http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html'
      >code of conduct</a>.</p>

  <p> We will make use of
      <a href="{{page.etherpad}}">this etherpad</a>
      during the workshop. Please use this to keep collaborative notes and ask 
      (and answer) each others questions. Feel free to tweet from the workshop using 
      <a href='https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23SWCLeeds'>#SWCLeeds</a>.</p>

<!-- MORE STUFF -->
<!-- 
  <h3>Workshop material</h3>
   <p>Much of the material we will be using during the workshop can be found online
      and you will need copies of this on your laptop. In order to download the material 
      for the first session on bash (and to
      check you have a working system with internet access) please start a new
      shell and type the following commands:
<pre class="in">
<code>cd 
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/gracecox/2016-01-18-leeds-bash.git
cd 2016-01-18-leeds-bash</code></pre>
      (typing return after each line). You should see something like
      "repository successfully cloned". Let us know if this does not work 
      for you.
   </p>
   <p>The python material is is avalable in the same way. To get hold of the
      data (and the files we created during the workshop) type:
<pre class="in">
<code>cd 
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/callaghanmt/2016-01-18-leeds-pystudents.git
cd 2016-01-18-leeds-pystudents</code></pre>
   </p>
   
-->
<!--
  <h3>Stuck somewhere new?</h3>
   <p>
    If you find yourself in a shell that you don't recognise, or in an editor 
    that you can't get out of then see 
    <a href="http://hpcarcher.github.io/2015-04-16-imperial/novice/ref/05-prompts-exits.html">recognising prompts and how to exit</a>.
